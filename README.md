## Basics
### Quadrature Signals
- https://www.ieee.li/pdf/essay/quadrature_signals.pdf
### Phase Locked Loop (PLL): 
Create stable signal reference. Use a stable low freq reference (Crystal) to stabilize a high freq unstable ref (VCO).

### Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)
- Usually unstable, and require something like a PLL to stabilize 
### Operational Amplifiers

- Gain is huge
- In open loop configuration, they are just comparators; Add negative feedback to become amplifiers rather than comparators
- If non-inverting input is higher than inverting input, output will be V+
- If non-inverting input is lower than inverting input, output will be V-
- Called "Operational" cause they were designed to perform mathematical "operations."
- Can be used as a buffer in buffer configuration
- Input impedance is high, so wonâ€™t draw current or effect anything on the input side
- Output impedance is low, so you can drive a bit of current through it. Tens of milliamps
- Non-Inverting Amp Configuration (Single Ended Amp)
    - Gain = Rf/R1 + 1
- Inverting Amp configuration
    - Gain = Rf/R1
    - Input * Gain * -1
    - With DC supply, it can never go negative. So need to off set and can do that by supply 1/2 Vcc to non-inverting pin
